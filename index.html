        <p class="push-1-2 milli">My name is Nila and I am a graphic designer with a passion for code and animal rights.</p>
        <p class="push-1-2 milli">Since I began working as a graphic designer, I’ve spent so much time skipping between what I wanted to focus on. I started loving typography and illustration and imagined myself working on packaging design for years to come. I've always been someone who is driven by improvement and getting my projects to near perfection. Whether it's myself, something I'm working on, or helping others—I love helping others work their problems out.</p>
        <p class="push-1-2 milli">Nowadays, I've spent countless hours coding away in Atom until I can solve the problem at hand. I care deeply about the work that I produce and the way it impacts the community and the environment. I’ve always been someone who signs dozens of petitions in a row or can have a long discussion with others about how animals are treated.</p>
        <p class="push-1-2 milli">I believe our planet is beautiful and that’s what I want to do—help the planet by making beautiful designs that will make a difference. Even if the change seems small, it’s for the greater good. So let's work together and create something that will make a difference!</p>
